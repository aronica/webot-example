Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).
For example: Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7} ,

The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
Here's an example:
