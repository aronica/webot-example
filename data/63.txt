              <p/><p>Follow up for "Unique Paths":</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>An obstacle and empty space is marked as <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> respectively in the grid.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For example,<br/>&#13;
</p><p>There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.</p>&#13;
<pre>&#13;
[&#13;
  [0,0,0],&#13;
  [0,1,0],&#13;
  [0,0,0]&#13;
]&#13;
</pre>&#13;
<p>The total number of unique paths is <code>2</code>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><b>Note:</b> <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> will be at most 100.</p>
