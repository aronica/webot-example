              <p/><p>The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Given a non-negative integer <i>n</i> representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For example, given <i>n</i> = 2, return <code>[0,1,3,2]</code>. Its gray code sequence is:</p>&#13;
<pre>&#13;
00 - 0&#13;
01 - 1&#13;
11 - 3&#13;
10 - 2&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p><b>Note:</b><br/>&#13;
For a given <i>n</i>, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<p>For example, <code>[0,2,3,1]</code> is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.</p>
