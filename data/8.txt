              <p/><p>Implement <span style="font-family:monospace">atoi</span> to convert a string to an integer.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><b>Hint:</b> Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>&#13;
<b>Notes:</b> &#13;
It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front. </p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="showspoilers"><a href="#" onclick="showSpoilers(this); return false;">spoilers alert... click to show requirements for atoi.</a></p>&#13;

<div class="spoilers"><b>Requirements for atoi:</b>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. If the correct value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2147483647) or INT_MIN (-2147483648) is returned.&#13;
