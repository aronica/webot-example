Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).
For example, this binary tree is symmetric:
But the following is not:
Note: Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.

The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
Here's an example:
