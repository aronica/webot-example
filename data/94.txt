Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.
For example: Given binary tree {1,#,2,3} ,
return [1,3,2] .
Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
Here's an example:
