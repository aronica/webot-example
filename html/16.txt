              <p/><p>Given an array <i>S</i> of <i>n</i> integers, find three integers in <i>S</i> such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre>&#13;
    For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.&#13;
&#13;
    The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).&#13;
