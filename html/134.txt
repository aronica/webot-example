              <p/><p>&#13;
There are <i>N</i> gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station <i>i</i> is <code>gas[i]</code>.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>&#13;
You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs <code>cost[i]</code> of gas to travel from station <i>i</i> to its next station (<i>i</i>+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>&#13;
Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.&#13;

<b>Note:</b><br/>&#13;
The solution is guaranteed to be unique.&#13;
