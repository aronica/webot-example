</p><p>The demons had captured the princess (<b>P</b>) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (<b>K</b>) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess. </p>&#13;
<p>The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately. </p>&#13;
<p>Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (<i>negative</i> integers) upon entering these rooms; &#13;
other rooms are either empty (<i>0's</i>) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (<i>positive</i> integers).</p>&#13;
<p>In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step. </p>&#13;
&#13;
<br/>&#13;
<p><b>Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.</b></p>&#13;
<p>For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least <b>7</b> if he follows the optimal path <code>RIGHT-&gt; RIGHT -&gt; DOWN -&gt; DOWN</code>.</p>&#13;

<p><b>Notes:</b>&#13;
</p><ul>&#13;
<li>The knight's health has no upper bound.</li>&#13;
<li>Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.  </li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
