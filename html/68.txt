              <p/><p>&#13;
Given an array of words and a length <i>L</i>, format the text such that each line has exactly <i>L</i> characters and is fully (left and right) justified.&#13;
</p> &#13;
&#13;
<p>&#13;
You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces <code>' '</code> when necessary so that each line has exactly <i>L</i> characters.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>&#13;
Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>&#13;
For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>&#13;
For example,<br/>&#13;
<b>words</b>: <code>["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]</code><br/>&#13;
<b>L</b>: <code>16</code>.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>&#13;
Return the formatted lines as:<br/>&#13;
</p><pre>&#13;
[&#13;
   "This    is    an",&#13;
   "example  of text",&#13;
   "justification.  "&#13;
]&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>&#13;
<b>Note:</b> Each word is guaranteed not to exceed <i>L</i> in length.&#13;
